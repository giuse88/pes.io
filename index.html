          </div>

          <p>Hi, I'm a software engineer passionate about software craftsmanship.</p>

          <h2 id="about-me" class="hr"><span class="hr">ABOUT ME</span></h2>
          <p>I come from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sardinia" target="_blank"> Sardinia </a>, I love Pasta, Pizza and I cannot live without my espresso. Like most of Italians probably. Now I live in
          London, where I can enjoy a thrilling and multicultural city.
          </p>
          <p>
            I work as full stack engineer at <a href="http://www.qubitproducts.com" target="_blank">Qubit</a>, building awesome web
            apps with the best technologies out there.
            I work mostly with Node and React. In the past, I worked for <a href="http://www.ibm.com" target="_blank">IBM</a> as Java developer using
            Spring, EJB 3.1 and WebSphere.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my spare time, I try new technologies which excite me (e.g. WebRTC) or new programming approaches
            (e.g. reactive programming and functional programming). In addition, I am also learning Salsa with the hope, one day, to truly enjoy dancing.
          </p>
          <!--
          <p>
          I am really lucky person as I truly enjoy my job. I love coding and I am always eager to improve and learn new things.
          I learn coding on my own when I was 15 falling in love C. Since then, I've been fascinated by the limitless things you could do with just a computer.
          I have to thank my parents for this, they provided my with every thing I need since I was really young to purse my dreams. I had my first 386
          when I was 6. I still remember, when I used to type WIN in the DOS terminal to start Windows 3.1.
          </p>

         <h5> Squiddy </h5>
          <p> Squiddy is a multi-users video conference tool built with WebRTC. I built this to learn WebRTC so it doesn't use any library.
              Squiddy performs session renegotiation when something changes. For instance, if a user turns off the video, the video stream
              is not paused, but it is removed from the session. This leads to a better use of the bandwidth, but causes a lot of compatibilities issues
              due to the early stage of the WebRTC technologies.
          </p>

         <h5> MVH </h5>
         <p>
          MVH stands for Multi Variant Honeypot. This is my MSc final project. MVH is a multi variant honeypot system which uses a interposition
          delegating architecture to execute untrusted code. MVH has two variants, one private and one public running in parallel and it is able
          to detect, prevent and record malicious behaviour of the public variant ( e.g. public web server) be by comparing the system calls
          made by each variant. The MVH effectiveness has been proved by attacking a <a href="http://www.lighttpd.net/" target="_blank" > Lighthhtp </a>
          server affected by a buffer overflow bug. MVH was able to prevent and record any malicious action performed by the attacked.
